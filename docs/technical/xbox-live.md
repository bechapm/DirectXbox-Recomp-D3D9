# Xbox Live (Insignia)

Original Xbox Live was shut down in 2010. [Insignia](https://insignia.live/)
replaces its servers for 199 titles, Rainbow Six 3 (`55530013`) among them.
This page records what the runtime does toward it and what was measured.
The plan is in `docs/System Link over the internet.md` (phase 8).

**Status (16 Oct 2026):** the card reaches the internet through a router in
the runtime, and a real console's identity is loaded from the player's own
backup. No title has signed in yet; Rainbow Six 3's Xbox Live menu has not
been tried.

## The client is already here

The Xbox Live client library (XOnline) is not in the dashboard or the kernel:
it is linked into every Live title, so the recompiler lifts it with the rest
of the game. What it needs from the runtime is what a console gives it:

| Piece | Where | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A network card and a cable | `xbox_nic.c`, `xbox_net_udp.c` | done, Windows and macOS |
| A router: DHCP, DNS servers, UDP out | `xbox_net_nat.c`, `syslink = nat` | done; `tests/net_nat` |
| The console's identity | `xbox_console_id.c` | done; `tests/console_id` |
| The kernel's crypto, exactly | `kernel_crypto.c`, `xbox_crypto_soft.c` | to check, export by export |
| The kernel's keys from the BIOS (`XboxSignatureKey`, `XePublicKeyData`, `XboxLANKey`) | `kernel_bridge.c` | zeros today |
| A user account on the disk | `Partition0.img`, from the backup | copied; not yet signed in with |

Rainbow Six 3 imports, besides the usual: `ExQueryNonVolatileSetting` (24),
`XboxHDKey` (323), `XboxSignatureKey` (325), `XboxLANKey` (353),
`XboxAlternateSignatureKeys` (354), `XePublicKeyData` (355), and the crypto
exports 335 to 349 (SHA-1, RC4, HMAC, `XcVerifyPKCS1Signature`, `XcModExp`,
DES and triple DES).

## What the protocol needs from the network

From Tristan Miller's DEF CON 30 talk (*Reversing the Original Xbox Live
Protocols*), the source of [Xombie](https://github.com/xombieonline/xombie):

- DNS for three targets only: MACS (machine account creation), the Kerberos
  AS and TGS, and a security gateway.
- Kerberos with Microsoft's pre-authentication extensions. MACS creates the
  machine account from the EEPROM's online key; its name is `SN.<serial>`.
- Everything after sign-in goes through the security gateway on UDP 3074, a
  VPN that carries the title's TCP and UDP inside it. A title has no TCP of
  its own on the wire, so the router carrying UDP alone is enough.

## The router (`syslink = nat`)

See the comment at the top of `xbox_net_nat.c`. The console is given
10.0.2.15 behind 10.0.2.2 (QEMU's layout), with Insignia's DNS
(46.101.64.175) first and 1.1.1.1 second. Rainbow Six 3 on macOS takes the
lease 17 ms after its first DHCPDISCOVER.

| Switch | |
| --- | --- |
| `RECOMP_SYSLINK=nat` (`syslink = nat`) | the card cabled to the internet |
| `RECOMP_NET_DNS` (`net_dns`) | the DNS servers handed out |
| `RECOMP_NET_LOG=1` | a line per UDP mapping and remote |
| `RECOMP_NET_PCAP=<file>` | every frame both ways, for Wireshark; it holds sign-in traffic, so keep it private |
| `RECOMP_NET_FRESH_PORTS=1` | never bind the console's own port on this PC |

The first 48 DNS names asked for are logged as `[NET] DNS: <name>`.

## The console's identity

See the comment at the top of `xbox_console_id.c`. The player backs up their
own console (EvoX, UnleashX and XBMC all do: `eeprom.bin` and `hddinfo.txt`)
into a folder `xboxbackup/` beside the game folder, or names it with
`console_dir`. From it come the serial, the Ethernet address and the online
key (`ExQueryNonVolatileSetting`), `XboxHDKey`, and the drive's serial and
model. The EEPROM's checksums are checked before any of it is used; nothing
is logged but where it came from and the address's maker prefix.

EvoX's `hddkey.bin` is the drive's lock password, not the HDD key. The key
is the `XboxHDKey` line of `hddinfo.txt`.

With an identity loaded, every copy run from that game folder is the same
console. Two copies in one System Link session need `console_dir = off` on
one of them.

## Accounts

XOnline keeps the console's accounts in the hard disk's config area, which
the runtime backs with `Partition0.img`. Rainbow Six 3 reads sector 8 and
sector 9 as its network starts. From a backup taken after signing up on
Insignia (EvoX's `disk.bin`, the drive's first 512 KB):

| Sector | What |
| --- | --- |
| 8 | an index the title updates every run |
| 9 | the machine account: named `SN.<serial>`, domain `insignia.live`, realm `passport.net` |
| 12 | the user account: the gamertag, domain `insignia.live`, realm `PASSPORT.NET` |

Each record starts 0x0C into its sector (name at +0x0C, Kerberos domain at
+0x24, realm at +0x38), the layout
[feudalnate/Original-Xbox-LIVE-Account](https://github.com/feudalnate/Original-Xbox-LIVE-Account)
describes. A backup from before signing up held a machine account from the
original Xbox Live (domain `xbox.com`) and no user account.

`xbox_console_import_accounts` copies sectors 8 to 15 from `disk.bin` onto
the disk image when the image has no account yet, and keeps the image's own
otherwise (`console_accounts = replace` takes the backup's, `off` leaves the
image alone). A title asking to sign up with no account on the disk reboots
to the dashboard (`HalReturnToFirmware`, launch reason 7) and, with none to
go to, comes back to itself: that is what an empty disk looks like.

## Signing in, measured (Rainbow Six 3, 16 Oct 2026)

Through the router, with the player's console identity and accounts:
DNS for `AS.XBOXLIVE.COM`, two AS exchanges (machine, then user) and a
TGS exchange with Insignia all succeed. Insignia's TGS-REP then carries
`XONLINE_E_LOGON_UPDATE_REQUIRED` (0x80151002): the title needs its
update. What it took, in order:

- A hard-drive copy's Live block undone (Rainbow Six 3's
  `scripts/live_unpatch.py`).
- The EEPROM's block reads answering the EEPROM (XNet reads all of it).
- `RtlNtStatusToDosError` mapping facility-7 statuses (XNet's "would
  block", 0x800703E5) on POSIX.
- XOnline's TGS-REQ body encoder seeded (reached only through its ASN.1
  encoder table).

## The online updater (`titles/xodash-update`)

On "update required", choosing OK makes the title call its title-update
routine, which reboots into `\Device\CdRom0;update.xbe` with launch data
naming the title (type 0, title ID at +4). The dashboard's own updater (the
5960 `xodash/update.xbe`, "Online Updater Application", title FFFE0000) is
recompiled in `titles/xodash-update`, its files in `games/xodash-update`
(the player's own, from their console's C: drive), 25 seeds found by run.

The runtime hands off between recompiled images by a launch map
(`launch_map` / `RECOMP_LAUNCH_MAP`, `kernel_bridge.c`): an Xbox path's
tail or a title ID to a host executable, optionally `|` its game folder.
The launch data page goes along in `RECOMP_LAUNCH_DATA`.

    RECOMP_LAUNCH_MAP="update.xbe=<xodash_update_recomp>|<games/xodash-update>;55530013=<rs3_recomp>|<rs3 game folder>"

### Running it

RS3's update flow, as a console has it: the title launches the updater
from its own disc (`d:\update.xbe`), so the updater's D: is the title's
disc, its own files come from C:, and it installs into the title's
`E:\TDATA\<id>\$u`, which the title reads at boot. The settings that give
the recompiled pair that layout, all inherited across the hand-off:

    RECOMP_LAUNCH_MAP = update.xbe=<xodash_update_recomp>|<rs3 game>;55530013=<rs3_recomp>|<rs3 game>
    RECOMP_HDD_DIR    = <one folder>     E: shared by both (hdd_dir)
    RECOMP_DISC_OVERLAY = <folder>        the disc's default.xbe, laid over D: (disc_overlay)
    RECOMP_SYSTEM_DIR = (the updater sets it to its own folder: a copy of
                        the console's C:, with xboxdash.xbe and xodash\)
    RECOMP_SYSLINK    = nat

### Measured (16 Oct 2026, macOS)

The whole chain runs: RS3 signs in, is told an update is required, hands
off on OK; the updater (after YES) signs in, opens Insignia's security
gateway (51.68.122.14:3074 -- the first working SG connection), downloads
`/ogx/55530013/0000000100000501.xcp` (title update 0x501, 9,083,651 bytes)
over TCP, unpacks it into `z:\$t` and installs into `TDATA\55530013\$u`.
`$u\default.xbe` comes out byte for byte the genuine 0x501 XBE.

It stopped at `downloader.xbe`: the update carries it as an 896-byte delta
(PA19) against the disc's `d:\downloader.xbe`, and a hard-drive copy made
for a console drops that file (with update.xbe), so the delta has nothing
to apply to and the hash check fails (ERROR_INVALID_DATA). A console
running the same copy fails the same way.

The updater now skips such a file (18 Oct, `titles/xodash-update`
`recomp_manual.c`). The install is a state machine (`sub_000608B6` on the
state at +0xC): state 9 (`sub_00061127`) opens the disc's original, leaving
its size at +0x74 = 0 when there is none, and state 0x12 (`sub_000606AB`)
checks the SHA-1, setting state 8 (next file) or failing with
0x8007000D. A failed check with no original is turned into state 8, the
output (`f:\$u\<name>`) removed and the source name logged; state 9's path
buffer (+0x38034) is reused by then, so it is kept when state 9 runs. The
install then matches the console's minus that one file.

### Without settings (18 Oct 2026)

`src/kernel/xbox_title_update.c` gives the chain defaults, so a play folder
laid out as the guide's Step 5b needs no launch map:

- no `launch_map` entry for `...update.xbe`: `xodash_update_recomp` beside
  the executable or in `updater/` (`updater` setting), with this title's
  game folder (its D:);
- no entry for a title ID: `RECOMP_RETURN_TO`, which each hand-off sets to
  `<title id>=<its own executable>|<game folder>`;
- `hdd_dir`, `console_dir`, `syslink` and the disc overlay go along in the
  environment, since the updater reads `FFFE0000.conf`, not the title's;
- `disc_overlay` defaults to `disc_overlay/` beside the executable when it
  holds a `default.xbe`;
- the disc's build, after `xbox_path_init`, calls
  `xbox_title_update_handoff`: with `E:\TDATA\<id>\$u\default.xbe` present and
  the update's build beside it (or `title_update_exe`), it starts that,
  passing the XBE's host path in `RECOMP_TITLE_UPDATE_XBE`. The disc's XAPI
  launches `\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\TDATA\<id>\$u\default.xbe` itself at
  start-up when it is there (seen on RS3 with no launch data), so that launch
  maps to the same build; without one the title ends, as before.

What it took in the runtime, each the blocker after the one before:

- D3D: the title's swap callback (`D3DDevice__m_SwapCallback_OFFSET`)
  raised after each flip. The updater draws nothing until it clears its
  "frame in flight" flag.
- `hdd_dir`: one E: for every title; `system_dir`: C: and Y: apart from D:;
  `disc_xbe`: the disc's own XBE behind D:\default.xbe.
- A volume root (`PartitionN\`, through a drive link too) is a directory
  to NtQueryFullAttributesFile.
- The router carries TCP (`xbox_net_nat.c`): it ends the console's
  connection and relays it over a socket of this PC's.
- POSIX: a missing folder on the way is STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND (the
  updater makes folders on ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND only); a delete-on-close
  folder is rmdir'd; an empty search's first answer is STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE,
  as FATX gives it (Windows too).

## Next

1. Rainbow Six 3's Xbox Live menu through the router, with `RECOMP_NET_PCAP`:
   which names it asks for, and how far the Kerberos exchange gets.
2. The crypto exports checked against known answers, and the BIOS's keys.
3. Sign-in with the account copied from the console.
4. A local Xombie as a second server to check each step against.
