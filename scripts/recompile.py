"""
Run the whole recompilation pipeline for one title.

The four stages have to run in order and each reads the previous one's output,
so running them by hand mostly means retyping the same XBE path four times and
remembering that stage 2 needs the JSON from stage 1.

    python3 scripts/recompile.py game_files/default.xbe

Defaults to --game-only. Lifting CRT and XDK code you intend to HLE away costs
compile time and debugging attention for code you will not run; switch to --all
only when you have a reason.

Stages:
    1. parse    tools.xbe_parser   header, sections, imports -> analysis JSON
    2. disasm   tools.disasm       .text -> instructions, functions, xrefs
    3. identify tools.func_id      classify CRT / RenderWare / game functions
    4. lift     tools.recomp       x86 -> C

Re-run a later stage on its own after changing something:

    python3 scripts/recompile.py game.xbe --from identify
    python3 scripts/recompile.py game.xbe --only lift --all

Working on more than one title: give each its own stage outputs and its own
project, or the second title silently lifts from the first one's disassembly
(every retail XBE is called default.xbe, and that name is all the guard checks):
