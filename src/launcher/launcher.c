 * launcher.c -- the window a player opens before the game.
 *
 * Its whole job: show the handful of settings that are worth choosing,
 * write them to the file the runtime reads, start the game and get out
 * of the way. Everything else the runtime can be told stays where it
 * was, in environment variables, for people who want it.
 *
 * It can be driven entirely with a pad. That is not a flourish: the
 * front ends this ships inside -- a living-room build, GameNative and
 * the like -- may never see a keyboard, and a launcher that needs a
 * mouse to get past is a launcher that stops the game starting. D-pad
 * or stick to move, A to play, B to quit, shoulders to change tab.
 *
 * The drawing is all in launcher_theme.c, so this file is about what the
 * settings are and how they are moved between, not about pixels. The window
 * is the front end's (launcher.h), so nothing here is one host's.
