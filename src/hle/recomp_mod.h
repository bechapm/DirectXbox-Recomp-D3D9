/*
 * Mods: libraries a player drops beside the game, loaded when the game's
 * Direct3D device is made (recomp_mods.c). A mod changes or adds to a title
 * without being built into it -- RTX Remix support for one game, a tool,
 * a fix someone wants to try -- so the title's own build stays the port.
 *
 * Where: the folder `mods` beside the executable; every .dll (Windows) or
 * .so (elsewhere) in it, in name order. RECOMP_MOD_LIBS=0 loads none;
 * RECOMP_MOD_LIBS_DIR names another folder. (Not to be confused with a
 * title's own asset mods, such as split2-recomp's RECOMP_MODS folders.)
 *
 * What a mod exports: one C function,
 *
 *     int recomp_mod_init(const RecompModApi *api);
 *
 * called once, on the thread making the device, as it starts making it
 * (so before the device exists, and before the title's first draw). It returns nonzero to stay loaded; zero (not this title, say) and
 * it is unloaded again. The api it is handed lives for the whole run.
 *
 * This header is the whole contract, and stands alone: a mod is built
 * against a copy of it, not against the toolkit. Fields are only ever
 * added at the end; a mod checks `size` before using one newer than it
 * knows, and `version` names the newest set. (Versions 1 and 2 were never
 * released, and 3 is laid out anew: a mod built against them is rebuilt.)
 *
 * Mods are loaded by d3d8_replay too, when it replays a frame capture
 * (RECOMP_D3D8_CAPTURE_AT), so a mod's changes to the picture can be seen
 * on the same frames again and again. There the title is not running:
 * `replaying` says so, guest_pointer returns NULL and vertex_constants
 * returns 0. What a mod needs from the title's memory to draw a frame it
 * stores in the capture as it is made (capture_note), and gets back at the
 * same point of the replay (replay_on_note).
