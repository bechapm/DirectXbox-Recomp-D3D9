/*
 * hle_dsound_stream.c -- DirectSound streams replaced by name.
 *
 * A DirectSound *buffer* holds a whole sound; a *stream* is fed packets
 * (XMEDIAPACKET) as the title decodes them from disc, and is how titles play
 * music. TimeSplitters 2 opens its music as WAV media objects
 * (XWaveFileCreateMediaObjectEx) and hands the data to a stream through
 * CDirectSoundStream_Process; its sound effects go through buffers, which
 * hle_dsound.c already sends to the host. So the effects were audible and the
 * music was not: the stream's own code drives the emulated audio chip, which
 * has no output, and the DirectSoundDoWork that would have serviced it is
 * replaced too.
 *
 * Same treatment as the buffers. The stream's format comes from the
 * DSSTREAMDESC at creation; each packet the title submits is queued and marked
 * pending; the queue plays on the host clock, decoded (PCM or Xbox ADPCM) and
 * fed to XAudio2 a little ahead of that clock; and a packet the clock has
 * passed is completed the way the console would: status XMEDIAPACKET_STATUS_
 * SUCCESS, its completed size, and then the stream's completion callback or
 * the packet's event. That completion is what makes the title submit the next
 * packet, so the stream keeps flowing.
 *
 * Streams are CDirectSoundStream objects and the title holds an
 * IDirectSoundStream interface pointer into them. The methods here take
 * `this` on the stack as their first argument (the thunks pop 4 bytes more
 * than the signature has parameters: Process is `ret 12`), and creation
 * returns the interface. Where the two differ by a constant the XDK version
 * decides, the first method call on an object binds it to the interface
 * created nearest above it.
 *
 * The clock. A stream's packets complete when the hardware has consumed
 * them, and on the console that is the audio hardware's own clock. Here the
 * host plays the samples, so the host is asked where it is
 * (recomp_audio_output_position) and the clock is pulled onto that reading
 * every tick. Wall-clock time is only the fallback -- for a format the host
 * cannot play, before the voice exists, and while the voice is dry -- because
 * a wall clock drifts away from what is coming out of the speakers by the
 * device's rate error and by every gap the queue ran dry for, and a title
 * that paces a cutscene on its music drifts with it. RECOMP_DSOUND_WALLCLOCK=1
 * keeps the old behaviour, and the five-second line reports the correction
 * being applied so drift can be seen rather than guessed at.
 *
 * SYNCHPLAYBACK holds a stream until IDirectSound::SynchPlayback
 * (hle_dsound.c); envelope and 3D settings are ignored; a stream whose format the host cannot play still completes packets
 * on the clock, silently, so the title does not stall on it.
