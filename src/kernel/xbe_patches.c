/*
 * XBE patches at load (xbe_patches.h, docs/technical/xbe-patches.md).
 *
 * The operations themselves -- add a section, patch, copy, fill -- are carried
 * out once, by tools/xbe_patch, on the XBE the pipeline lifts. What reaches
 * this file is their result as byte runs over the original file: apply them to
 * the default.xbe the player has and it becomes, byte for byte, the image that
 * was lifted, header included (the section table that names the new section,
 * the larger image size). The loader then maps it like any other XBE, so the
 * added section is mapped, the copied table is in it, and code bytes the
 * title reads match the code that was lifted -- all before the entry point.
 *
 * Blob layout (little-endian; tools.xbe_patch.build_blob):
 *   "XBEP", u32 version (1), u32 original size, u32 patched size,
 *   u8[20] SHA-1 of the original, u8[20] SHA-1 of the patched image,
 *   u32 run count, then per run: u32 file offset, u32 length, u8[length].
