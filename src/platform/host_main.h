 * host_main.h - what a title's main.c needs from the host operating system.
 *
 * A title's start-up (templates/new-game/src/main.c) is portable C: find the
 * game, load the XBE, bring up the runtime, call the entry point. The pieces
 * of it that are not -- where the executable is, where its output goes, how
 * a fatal message is shown, how a host address is named, and on POSIX which
 * thread the title runs on -- are here, with a Windows half
 * (host_main_win32.c) and a POSIX half (host_main_posix.c).
