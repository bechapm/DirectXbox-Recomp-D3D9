/*
 * recomp_config.h -- the settings a player chooses, and where they live.
 *
 * Everything the runtime can be told is an environment variable, which is
 * right for a developer and no use to someone who just wants the game in
 * widescreen. This is the other half: a small file the launcher writes and
 * the runtime reads, so a setting survives being chosen once.
 *
 * The environment still wins. A variable set on the command line, in a
 * .bat, or by CI overrides the file, so every existing way of driving the
 * runtime keeps working and the file is what happens when nothing said
 * otherwise. Callers say both names at the point of use:
 *
 *     v = recomp_config_lookup("RECOMP_RES_SCALE", "resolution_scale");
 *
 * which keeps the precedence visible where the setting is read rather
 * than buried here.
 *
 * The file is per title, keyed by the title id out of the XBE
 * certificate: a resolution scale is a judgement about one game on one
 * machine, and the Hor+ register is meaningless to any other game. Input
 * bindings are deliberately not here -- those belong to the person, not
 * the title, and they already have a file of their own.
 *
 * It is an INI rather than JSON because the settings are flat and because
 * a generated INI can explain itself. The file a player opens says what
 * each line does; JSON has nowhere to put that.

 * Xbox widescreen is anamorphic: the console says it is 16:9, and a title

 * into the same 640x480 for the display to stretch back. For that title
 * the flag and a 16:9 presentation are the whole job (Burnout 2, OutRun 2).
 * A title with no such mode (TimeSplitters 2) ignores the flag and draws
 * 4:3, which presented at 16:9 is the same view stretched; it needs its
 * camera widened as well -- Hor+ -- and the register its projection is in.
 *
 * Those used to be two switches in the launcher, and choosing the wrong
 * pair gave a stretched picture or a view widened twice. Now the player
 * has one, `widescreen`, and the rest is resolved here when the game
 * starts, from what the title's project has said about it. */
